## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my second challenge which i have done, my first one was qr-code (i had though time doing it since i was trying alot things to achieve end goal) but now as compared to my first project, i can see that my perspective to approach things have changed and i have learned alot (from youtube, google, stackoverflow).

### Continued development

Next time, i will try to look into CSS more. Since, i think that most of the time for me goes there.
Formatting HTML Content Structure properly so that CSS layout would be much easier. I mean to say, to giving out classes name, using multiple classes and all
